We theorize how the ongoing technological developments reinforce the traditional functions of data as instruments of management and control but also reframe and extend their role. By rendering data as technical entities, digital technologies transform the process of knowing and the knowledge functions data fulﬁl in socioeconomic life. These functions are most of the times mediated by putting together disperse and steadily updatable data in more stable entities we refer to as data objects. Users, customers, products, and physical machines rendered as data objects become the technical and cognitive means through which organizational knowledge, patterns, and practices develop. Such conditions loosen the dependence of data from domain knowledge, reorder the relative signiﬁcance of internal versus external references in organizations, and contribute to a paradigmatic contemporary development that we identify with the decentering of organizations of which digital platforms are an important specimen.",

      "abstractNote": "Past research offers mixed perspectives on whether domain experience helps or hurts algorithm-augmented worker performance. Reconciling these perspectives, we theorize that intermediate levels of domain experience are optimal for algorithm-augmented performance, due to the interplay between two countervailing forces—ability and aversion. Although domain experience can increase performance via increased ability to complement algorithmic advice (e.g., identifying inaccurate predictions), it can also decrease performance via increased aversion to accurate algorithmic advice. Because ability developed through learning by doing increases at a decreasing rate, and algorithmic aversion is more prevalent among experts, we theorize that algorithm-augmented performance will ﬁrst rise with increasing domain experience, then fall. We test this by exploiting a within-subjects experiment in which corporate information technology support workers were assigned to resolve problems both manually and using an algorithmic tool. We conﬁrm that the difference between performance with the algorithmic tool versus without the tool was characterized by an inverted U-shape over the range of domain experience. Only workers with moderate domain experience did signiﬁcantly better using the algorithm than resolving tickets manually. These ﬁndings highlight that, even if greater domain experience increases workers’ ability to complement algorithms, domain experience can also trigger other mechanisms that overcome the positive ability effect and inhibit performance. Additional analyses and participant interviews suggest that, even though the highest experience workers had the greatest ability to complement the algorithmic tool, they rejected its advice because they felt greater accountability for possible unintended consequences of accepting algorithmic advice.",

In this paper we explore the uses and beneﬁts of LLMs for researchers and practitioners who aim to understand consumer preferences. We focus on the distributional nature of LLM responses, and query the different LLMs to generate dozens of responses to each survey question. We offer two sets of results to illustrate and assess our approach. First, we show that estimates of willingness-to-pay for products and features derived from LLM responses are realistic and comparable to estimates from human studies. Second, we demonstrate a practical method for market researchers to enhance LLMs’ responses by incorporating previous survey data from similar contexts via ﬁne-tuning. This method improves the alignment of the LLM responses with human responses for existing and, importantly, new product features. We do not ﬁnd similar improvements in the alignment for new product categories or for differences between customer segments.",

      "abstractNote": "The use of machine learning (ML) for productivity in the knowledge economy requires considerations of important biases that may arise from ML predictions. We define a new source of bias related to incompleteness in real time inputs, which may result from strategic behavior by agents. We theorize that domain expertise of users can complement ML by mitigating this bias. Our observational and experimental analyses in the patent examination context support this conjecture. In the face of “input incompleteness,” we find ML is biased towards finding prior art textually similar to focal claims and domain expertise is needed to find the most relevant prior art. We also document the importance of vintage-specific skills, and discuss the implications for artificial intelligence and strategic management of human capital.",

      "abstractNote": "Where should better learning technology (such as machine learning or AI) improve decisions? I develop a model of decision-making in which better learning technology is complementary with experimentation. Noisy, inconsistent decision-making introduces quasi-experimental variation into training datasets, which complements learning. The model makes heterogeneous predictions about when machine learning algorithms can improve human biases. These algorithms can remove human biases exhibited in historical training data, but only if the human training decisions are sufficiently noisy; otherwise, the algorithms will codify or exacerbate existing biases. Algorithms need only a small amount of noise to correct biases that cause large productivity distortions. As the amount of noise increases, the machine learning can correct both large and increasingly small productivity distortions. The theoretical conditions necessary to completely eliminate bias are extreme and unlikely to appear in real datasets. The model provides theoretical microfoundations for why learning from biased historical datasets may lead to a decrease (if not a full elimination) of bias, as has been documented in several empirical settings. The model makes heterogeneous predictions about the use of human expertise in machine learning. Expert-labeled training datasets may be suboptimal if experts are insufficiently noisy, as prior research suggests. I discuss implications for regulation, labor markets, and business strategy.",

      "abstractNote": "This paper explores how artificial intelligence (AI) may impact the strategic decision-making (SDM) process in firms. We illustrate how AI could augment existing SDM tools and provide empirical evidence from a leading accelerator program and a start-up competition that current large language models can generate and evaluate strategies at a level comparable to entrepreneurs and investors. We then examine implications for the key cognitive processes underlying SDM—search, representation, and aggregation. Our analysis suggests that AI has the potential to enhance the speed, quality, and scale of strategic analysis, while also enabling new approaches, like virtual strategy simulations. However, the ultimate impact on firm performance will depend on competitive dynamics as AI capabilities progress. We propose a framework connecting AI use in SDM to firm outcomes and discuss how AI may reshape sources of competitive advantage. We conclude by considering how AI could both support and challenge core tenets of the theory-based view of strategy. Overall, our work maps out an emerging research frontier at the intersection of AI and strategy.\n            History: This paper has been accepted for the Strategy Science Special Issue on Theory-Based View.\n            Funding: The authors are grateful to their collaborating organizations and to the University of Michigan, Bocconi University Junior Researchers’ Grant, and the INSEAD eLab Research Fund for financial support.",

      "abstractNote": "Digital technologies, enabled by data, algorithms, and artificial intelligence, are creating new competitive opportunities. But how does one strategize when the technologies core to organizational action is constantly changing? We suggest that for strategy scholars to answer this question, they will need to rethink the concept of technology. We begin by discussing the conceptual treatment of technology in studies of strategy and strategizing, and, in so doing, we highlight the ways in which current conceptualizations of technology are problematic for theorizing about the role of technology in the digital age. We then advance a relational perspective on technology that overcomes many of these problems. We illustrate the potential utility of this perspective for theories of strategic organization by using it to reconceptualize the boundaries of the firm, the process of innovation, and the process of organizational knowing.",

      "abstractNote": "Research Summary The search for new resources is costly and difficult within the resource-based view. Because search is costly, a common prescription is for firms to focus on their endowments—the resources they already possess. However, is there a way for firms to somehow find value amongst the “vast reservoirs” of external resources? We review existing forms of resource search and then suggest an alternative. Extending arguments from biology, we develop the idea of a firm-specific search image and highlight how search images can reveal resources not obvious to others. The search image notion speaks to how firms might uniquely identify dormant resources, even in seemingly efficient factor markets. We conclude with a discussion of how our arguments pertain to the resource-based view and the origins of resources. Managerial Summary How do managers and entrepreneurs search, identify, and find assets and resources in relentlessly competitive markets? Existing arguments largely suggest that firms should not engage in costly and competitive “external” search—instead they should focus “inside,” leveraging the endowments and resources they already possess. We argue that vast reservoirs of dormant resources are available, and that a particular form of external resource search offers a powerful alternative to the prescription to “look inside.” Specifically, we highlight how a “search image” can enable entrepreneurs and managers to search and see resources and value that is not obvious to others. In particular, the search for a functional need—and solution to a formulated problem—can help firms recognize and find dormant resources and create value.",

      "abstractNote": "Scholars argue that artificial intelligence (AI) can generate genuine novelty and new knowledge and, in turn, that AI and computational models of cognition will replace human decision making under uncertainty. We disagree. We argue that AI’s data-based prediction is different from human theory-based causal logic and reasoning. We highlight problems with the decades-old analogy between computers and minds as input–output devices, using large language models as an example. Human cognition is better conceptualized as a form of theory-based causal reasoning rather than AI’s emphasis on information processing and data-based prediction. AI uses a probability-based approach to knowledge and is largely backward looking and imitative, whereas human cognition is forward-looking and capable of generating genuine novelty. We introduce the idea of data–belief asymmetries to highlight the difference between AI and human cognition, using the example of heavier-than-air flight to illustrate our arguments. Theory-based causal reasoning provides a cognitive mechanism for humans to intervene in the world and to engage in directed experimentation to generate new data. Throughout the article, we discuss the implications of our argument for understanding the origins of novelty, new knowledge, and decision making under uncertainty.",

      "abstractNote": "We suggest that AI can help decision-makers learn; specifically, that it can help them learn strategic interactions by serving as artificial training partners and thus help them to overcome a bottleneck of scarce human training partners. We present evidence from chess computers, the first widespread incarnation of AI. Leveraging the staggered diffusion of chess computers, we find that they did indeed help chess players improve by serving as a substitute for scarce human training partners. We also illustrate that chess computers were not a perfect substitute, as players training with them were not exposed to and thus did not learn to exploit idiosyncratic (“human”) mistakes. We discuss implications for research on learning, on AI in management and strategy, and on competitive advantage.",

      "abstractNote": "Research Summary Digital firms tend to be both narrow in their vertical scope and large in their scale. We explain this phenomenon through a theory about how attributes of firms' resource bundles impact their scale and specialization. We posit that highly scalable resource bundles entail significant opportunity costs of integration (vs. outsourcing), which simultaneously drive “hyperspecialization” and “hyperscaling” in digital firms. Using descriptive theory and a formal model, we develop several propositions that align with observed features of digital businesses. We offer a parsimonious modeling framework for resource-based theorizing about highly scalable digital firms, shed light on the phenomenon of digital scaling, and provide insights into the far-reaching ways that technology-enabled resources are reshaping firms in the digital economy. Managerial Summary Why are leading firms in the digital economy simultaneously larger and more specialized than those in the industrial age? Our research explains this phenomenon as being driven by the scalability of digital resources—that is, their capacity to create more value at larger scales when used intensively in a focal activity. We clarify what digital scalability means, and highlight trade-offs created by the opportunity costs of not employing scalable digital resources intensively. Digital firms should outsource complementary activities to avoid diverting resources away from their scalable core, and to enhance their ability to grow exponentially. Although resource fungibility and outsourcing costs mitigate these imperatives, digital firms may nonetheless find it profitable to remain specialized despite the challenges of managing outsourcing and sharing value with complementors.",

      "abstractNote": "Despite widespread speculation about artificial intelligence’s impact on the future of work, we lack systematic empirical evidence about how these systems are actually being used for different tasks. Here, we present a novel framework for measuring AI usage patterns across the economy. We leverage a recent privacy-preserving system [Tamkin et al., 2024] to analyze over four million Claude.ai conversations through the lens of tasks and occupations in the U.S. Department of Labor’s O*NET Database. Our analysis reveals that AI usage primarily concentrates in software development and writing tasks, which together account for nearly half of all total usage. However, usage of AI extends more broadly across the economy, with ∼ 36% of occupations using AI for at least a quarter of their associated tasks. We also analyze how AI is being used for tasks, finding 57% of usage suggests augmentation of human capabilities (e.g., learning or iterating on an output) while 43% suggests automation (e.g., fulfilling a request with minimal human involvement). While our data and methods face important limitations and only paint a picture of AI usage on a single platform, they provide an automated, granular approach for tracking AI’s evolving role in the economy and identifying leading indicators of future impact as these technologies continue to advance.",

Second, we explain the potential value to research of incorporating into resource-based inquiry new contexts (artificial intelligence and digitization, distributed organizations, and stakeholders and sustainability); new concepts (resource redeployment, market shaping through resources and capabilities); and new methods (text analysis and machine learning, formal models, policy capturing). The overall aim of this introduction is to help invigorate the resource-based view by spotlighting a series of promising new directions.",

      "abstractNote": "Can artificial intelligence (AI) assist human employees in increasing employee creativity? Drawing on research on AI-human collaboration, job design, and employee creativity, we examine AI assistance in the form of a sequential division of labor within organizations: in a task, AI handles the initial portion which is well-codified and repetitive, and employees focus on the subsequent portion involving higher-level problem-solving. First, we provide causal evidence from a field experiment conducted at a telemarketing company. We find that AI assistance in generating sales leads, on average, increases employees’ creativity in answering customers’ questions during subsequent sales persuasion. Enhanced creativity leads to increased sales. However, this effect is much more pronounced for higher-skilled employees. Next, we conducted a qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with the employees. We found that AI assistance changes job design by intensifying employees’ interactions with more serious customers. This change enables higher-skilled employees to generate innovative scripts and develop positive emotions at work, which are conducive to creativity. By contrast, with AI assistance, lower-skilled employees make limited improvements to scripts and experience negative emotions at work. We conclude that employees can achieve AI-augmented creativity, but this desirable outcome is skillbiased by favoring experts with greater job skills.",

      "abstractNote": "Beginning with Simon (1947)—and motivated by an interest in the effect of formal organizational structure on decision-making—a large body of research has examined how organizations process information. Yet, research in this area is extremely diverse and fragmented. We offer a retrospective of past research to summarize our collective knowledge, as well as identify and advance new concerns and questions. In doing so, we identify three critical issues: a division between an aggregation perspective and a constraint perspective of structure, little focus on informational sources of conflict, and uneven treatment of various stages of decision-making. We then offer a road map for future research that elaborates the role of organizational structure in decision-making. In this endeavor, we offer an ecological perspective of information processing that addresses the issues and provides opportunities to expand research in new directions.",

We identify four major approaches to organization design in the contemporary literature: configuration, control, channelization, and coordination. We discuss the key streams of research that characterize each of these approaches, as well as three emerging areas of research: AI and organizational decision-making, flat organizations, and multiple goals. Beyond the specific contributions of individual papers and streams of work, our review makes a number of high-level observations across approaches. We identify patterns that characterize this body of work, the methods used, open questions for future research, and a discussion of organization design as a theory. Collectively, these observations define the state of organization design research and may provide scholars with a foundation for future research.",

We find that both algorithms provided substantial prediction gains, suggesting that even simple data may be helpful. However, these gains did not result in improved decisions. Inspectors often used their decision authority to override algorithmic recommendations, partly to consider other organizational objectives without improving outcomes. Interviews with 55 departments find that while some ran pilots seeking to prioritize inspections using data, all provided considerable decision authority to inspectors. These findings suggest that for algorithms to improve managerial decisions, organizations must consider both the returns to algorithms in the context and how decision authority is managed.",

However, we show using computational models that ambiguity can compensate for semantic differences across communicators. Given the heterogeneity of humans with which artificial systems interact, semantic differences will be the norm. Therefore each time a machine starts to communicate with a new user, our results suggest it will do well to start with a moderately ambiguous code in order to more effectively bridge semantic differences. We dub this the “adaptive ambiguity” hypothesis.",

      "abstractNote": "The rapid emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is profoundly transforming the nature of work and organizations, challenging prevalent views of AI as primarily enabling prediction and optimization. This paper argues that GenAI represents a qualitative shift that necessitates a fundamental reassessment of AI’s role in management and organizations. By identifying and analyzing four critical dimensions – (i) GenAI’s broad applicability as a generalpurpose technology; (ii) its ability to catalyze exploratory and combinatorial innovation; (iii) its capacity to enhance cognitive diversity and decision-making; and (iv) its democratizing effect on AI adoption and value creation – the paper highlights GenAI’s potential to augment and scale human creativity, learning, and innovation. Building on insights from the AI and management literature, as well as on theory of human-AI agency, the paper develops a novel perspective that challenges the dominant efficiency-oriented narrative. It proposes that a human-complementary approach to GenAI development and implementation, leveraging it as a generative catalyst for exploration, can enable radically increased creativity, innovation, and growth. GenAI’s democratizing aspects can amplify these mechanisms, promoting widely shared growth when combined with appropriate policy and managerial choices. Implications for theory, practice, and future research directions are discussed, drawing attention to the need for approaches in GenAI development and deployment that are complementary rather than competitive to human beings. The paper concludes by discussing the theoretical, practical, and policy implications of this transformative technology. It outlines future research directions, emphasizing the critical role of human agency in determining the organizational, societal, and ethical outcomes associated with AI adoption and implementation.",

Following prior work on using chess as a controlled setting for studying competitive interactions, we compare the same players’ capabilities and performance across conventional, centaur, and engine chess tournaments. Our analysis shows that AI adoption triggers interrelated substitution and complementation dynamics, which make humans’ traditional competitive capabilities obsolete, while creating new sources of persistent heterogeneity when humans interact with chess engines. These novel human-machine capabilities are unrelated, or even negatively related, to traditional capabilities. We contribute an integrated view of substitution and complementation, which identifies AI as the driver of these dynamics and explains how they jointly shift the sources of competitive advantage. Managerial Summary AI-based technologies increasingly substitute and complement humans in managerial tasks such as decision making. We investigate how such change affects the sources of competitive advantage. AI-based engines’ adoption in chess allows us to investigate competitive capabilities and performance in human, AI, and hybrid settings. We find that neither humans nor AI in isolation explain performance differences in the AI and hybrid settings. Instead, a new decision-making resource emerges at the human-AI intersection, which drives performance but is unrelated or even negatively related to humans’ original capability. Our results document how AI adoption changes the sources of competitive advantage and, in turn, requires managers to develop new capabilities to stay relevant in an AI-based competitive landscape.",

      "abstractNote": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies promise to transform how professionals conduct knowledge work by augmenting their capabilities for making professional judgments. We know little, however, about how human-AI augmentation takes place in practice. Yet, gaining this understanding is particularly important when professionals use AI tools to form judgments on critical decisions. We conducted an in-depth field study in a major U.S. hospital where AI tools were used in three departments by diagnostic radiologists making breast cancer, lung cancer, and bone age determinations. The study illustrates the hindering effects of opacity that professionals experienced when using AI tools and explores how these professionals grappled with it in practice. In all three departments, this opacity resulted in professionals experiencing increased uncertainty because AI tool results often diverged from their initial judgment without providing underlying reasoning. Only in one department (of the three) did professionals consistently incorporate AI results into their final judgments, achieving what we call engaged augmentation. These professionals invested in AI interrogation practices—practices enacted by human experts to relate their own knowledge claims to AI knowledge claims. Professionals in the other two departments did not enact such practices and did not incorporate AI inputs into their final decisions, which we call unengaged “augmentation.” Our study unpacks the challenges involved in augmenting professional judgment with powerful, yet opaque, technologies and contributes to literature on AI adoption in knowledge work.",

      "abstractNote": "The recent rise of using digital representations for products and processes has created a movement to use ‘digital twins’ for organization design. We provide an overview of the notion of digital twin as a synchronized, real-time two-way interacting digital representation of the real-world phenomenon it is expected to replicate as a twin. The claim of a two-way causal connection between the real-world and the digital representation makes the current rhetoric about Digital Twins especially problematic. To grasp the challenges involved in Digital Twins of Organizations (DTO), we start from Digital Twins of Things (DTT) and Digital Twins of Business Processes (DTBP). We analyze and compare different kinds of digital twins using Peircean theory of semiotic relationships, which differentiate between signals, icons, and symbols. We posit that in order to fully model organizations as digital twins, an organization designer needs to model features of organizations that are not present in DTTs and DTBPs, such as agency, conflict, and emergence. Given the inevitable presence of symbolic phenomena, we speculate to what extent it is possible to move towards full DTOs, what characteristics broader DTOs need to have, and what benefits more extensive use of DTOs will offer for organization designers. We finally offer pointers towards a research agenda for DTOs that have the potential to improve organization designs and contribute to theory on organization design.",

      "abstractNote": "We examined 155 information systems research articles published from 1983 to 1988 and found that although this research is not rooted in a single over-arching theoretical perspective, it does exhibit a single set of philosophical assumptions regarding the nature of the phenomena studied by information systems researchers, and what constitutes valid knowledge about those phenomena. We believe that a single research perspective for studying information systems phenomena is unnecessarily restrictive, and argue that there exist other philosophical assumptions that can inform studies of the relationships between information technology, people, and organizations. In this paper, we present two additional research philosophies for consideration-the interpretive and the critical-and for each we provide empirical examples to illustrate how they are used. We conclude by suggesting that much can be gained if a plurality of research perspectives is effectively employed to investigate information systems phenomena.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article, we build on and extend research into the cognitions and values of users and designers by proposing a systematic approach for examining the underlying assumptions, expectations, and knowledge that people have about technology. Such interpretations of technology (which we call technological frames) are central to understanding technological development, use, and change in organizations. We suggest that where the technological frames of key groups in organizations—such as managers, technologists, and users— are significantly different, difficulties and conflict around the development, use, and change of technology may result. We use the findings of an empirical study to illustrate how the nature, value, and use of a groupware technology were interpreted by  various organizational stakeholders, resulting in outcomes that deviated from those expected. We argue that technological frames offer an interesting and useful analytic perspective for explaining an anticipating actions and meanings that are not easily obtained with other theoretical lenses.",

      "abstractNote": "In this article, we build on and extend research into the cognitions and values of users and designers by proposing a systematic approach for examining the underlying assumptions, expectations, and knowledge that people have about technology. Such interpretations of technology (which we call technological frames) are central to understanding technological development, use, and change in organizations. We suggest that where the technological frames of key groups in organizations—such as managers, technologists, and users— are significantly different, difficulties and conflict around the development, use, and change of technology may result. We use the findings of an empirical study to illustrate how the nature, value, and use of a groupware technology were interpreted by  various organizational stakeholders, resulting in outcomes that deviated from those expected. We argue that technological frames offer an interesting and useful analytic perspective for explaining an anticipating actions and meanings that are not easily obtained with other theoretical lenses.",

      "abstractNote": "When actors deem technological change undesirable, they may act symbolically by pretending to comply while avoiding real change. In our study of the introduction of an algorithmic technology in a sales organization, we found that such symbolic conformity led unintendedly to the full implementation of the suggested technological change. To explain this surprising outcome, we advance a regime-of-knowing lens that helps to analyze deep challenges happening under the surface during the process of technology introduction. A regime of knowing guides what is worth knowing, what actions matter to acquire this knowledge, and who has the authority to make decisions around those issues. We found that both the technologists who introduced the algorithmic technology, and the incumbent workers whose work was affected by the change, used symbolic actions to either defend the established regime of knowing or to advocate a radical change. Although the incumbent workers enacted symbolic conformity by pretending to comply with suggested changes, the technologists performed symbolic advocacy by presenting a positive side of the technological change. Ironically, because the symbolic conformity enabled and was reinforced by symbolic advocacy, reinforcing cycles of symbolic actions yielded a radical change in the sales’ regime of knowing: from one focused on a deep understanding of customers via personal contact and strong relationships, to one based on model predictions from the processing of large datasets. We discuss the theoretical implications of these ﬁndings for the introduction of technology at work and for knowing in the workplace.",

      "abstractNote": "Background\nPatients increasingly have direct access to their medical record. Radiology reports are complex and difficult for patients to understand and contextualize. One solution is to use large language models (LLMs) to translate reports into patient-accessible language.\nObjective\nThis review summarizes the existing literature on using LLMs for the simplification of patient radiology reports. We also propose guidelines for best practices in future studies.\nEvidence acquisition\nA systematic review was performed following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Studies published and indexed using PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar up to February 2025 were included. Inclusion criteria comprised studies that used LLMs for simplification of diagnostic or interventional radiology reports for patients and evaluated readability. Exclusion criteria included non-English publications, abstracts, conference presentations, review articles, retracted articles, and studies that did not focus on report simplification. The Mixed Methods Appraisal tool 2018 was used for bias assessment. Given the diversity of results, studies were categorized based on reporting methods, and qualitative and quantitative findings were presented to summarize key insights.\nEvidence synthesis\nA total of 2,126 citations were identified and 17 were included in the qualitative analysis. Of these studies, 71% used a single LLM, and 29% of studies used multiple LLMs. The most prevalent LLMs included ChatGPT, Google Bard/Gemini, Bing Chat, Claude, and Microsoft Copilot. All studies that assessed quantitative readability metrics (n = 12) reported improvements. Assessment of simplified reports via qualitative methods demonstrated varied results with physician versus nonphysician raters.\nConclusion and clinical impact\nLLMs demonstrate the potential to enhance the accessibility of radiology reports for patients, but the literature is limited by heterogeneity of inputs, models, and evaluation metrics across existing studies. We propose a set of best practice guidelines to standardize future LLM research.",

      "abstractNote": "This article explores a paradox inherent in AI-based training: as AI capabilities expand, offering superior training across diverse tasks, they simultaneously threaten to diminish the need for human involvement in those tasks. To address this, the article identifies seven contexts where AI-supported learning will remain valuable, even in domains where AI outperforms humans: intrinsic human mastery, empathy-driven social interactions, effective human–AI collaboration, the necessity of human oversight, integrated tasks at the \"jagged frontier\" of AI capabilities, institutional and legal constraints, and the signaling function of human credentials. By synthesizing recent empirical findings, the article illustrates conditions under which human skill development retains enduring relevance and argues that strategic investments in AIbased training can simultaneously leverage AI’s strengths and sustain human competencies essential for individual, organizational, and societal success.",

      "abstractNote": "A common justification for organizational change is that the circumstances in which the organization finds itself have changed, thereby eroding the value of utilizing existing knowledge. On the surface, the claim that organizations should adapt by generating new knowledge seems obvious and compelling. However, this standard wisdom overlooks the possibility that the reward to generating new knowledge may itself be eroded if change is an ongoing property of the environment. This observation in turn suggests that environmental change is not a self-evident call for strategies of greater exploration. Indeed, under some conditions the appropriate response to environmental change is a renewed focus on exploiting existing knowledge and opportunities. We develop a computational model based on the canonical multiarmed bandit formulation of exploration and exploitation. We endeavor to understand the mechanisms by which environmental change acts to make purposeful efforts at organizational adaptation less (or more) valuable.\n            This paper was accepted by Jesper Sørensen, organizations.",

      "abstractNote": "Taking three recent business books on artificial intelligence (AI) as a starting point, we explore the automation and augmentation concepts in the management domain. Whereas automation implies that machines take over a human task, augmentation means that humans collaborate closely with machines to perform a task. Taking a normative stance, the three books advise organizations to prioritize augmentation, which they relate to superior performance. Using a more comprehensive paradox theory perspective, we argue that, in the management domain, augmentation cannot be neatly separated from automation. These dual AI applications are interdependent across time and space, creating a paradoxical tension. Overemphasizing either augmentation or automation fuels reinforcing cycles with negative organizational and societal outcomes. However, if organizations adopt a broader perspective comprising both automation and augmentation, they could deal with the tension and achieve complementarities that benefit business and society. Drawing on our insights, we conclude that management scholars need to be involved in research on the use of AI in organizations. We also argue that a substantial change is required in how AI research is currently conducted in order to develop meaningful theory and to provide practice with sound advice.",

      "abstractNote": "How does organizational decision-making change with the advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-based decision-making algorithms? This article identifies the idiosyncrasies of human and AI-based decision making along five key contingency factors: specificity of the decision search space, interpretability of the decisionmaking process and outcome, size of the alternative set, decision-making speed, and replicability. Based on a comparison of human and AI-based decision making along these dimensions, the article builds a novel framework outlining how both modes of decision making may be combined to optimally benefit the quality of organizational decision making. The framework presents three structural categories in which decisions of organizational members can be combined with AI-based decisions: full human to AI delegation; hybrid—human-to-AI and AI-to-human—sequential decision making; and aggregated human–AI decision making.",

      "title": "Failures of Fairness in Automation Require a Deeper Understanding of Human–ML Augmentation",
      "abstractNote": "Machine learning (ML) tools reduce the costs of performing repetitive, time-consuming tasks yet run the risk of introducing systematic unfairness into organizational processes. Automated approaches to achieving fairness often fail in complex situations, leading some researchers to suggest that human augmentation of ML tools is necessary. However, our current understanding of human–ML augmentation remains limited. In this paper, we argue that the Information Systems (IS) discipline needs a more sophisticated view of and research into human–ML augmentation. We introduce a typology of augmentation for fairness consisting of four quadrants: reactive oversight, proactive oversight, informed reliance, and supervised reliance. We identify significant intersections with previous IS research and distinct managerial approaches to fairness for each quadrant. Several potential research questions emerge from fundamental differences between ML tools trained on data and traditional IS built with code. IS researchers may discover that the differences of ML tools undermine some of the fundamental assumptions upon which classic IS theories and concepts rest. ML may require massive rethinking of significant portions of the corpus of IS research in light of these differences, representing an exciting frontier for research into human–ML augmentation in the years ahead that IS researchers should embrace. 1",

      "abstractNote": "Companies are increasingly using artificial intelligence (AI) to provide performance feedback to employees, by tracking employee behavior at work, automating performance evaluations, and recommending job improvements. However, this application of AI has provoked much debate. On the one hand, powerful AI data analytics increase the quality of feedback, which may enhance employee productivity (“deployment effect”). On the other hand, employees may develop a negative perception of AI feedback once it is disclosed to them, thus harming their productivity (“disclosure effect”). We examine these two effects theoretically and test them empirically using data from a field experiment. We find strong evidence that both effects coexist, and that the adverse disclosure effect is mitigated by employees' tenure in the firm. These findings offer pivotal implications for management theory, practice, and public policies.",

      "abstractNote": "Big data are increasingly used to make predictions about the value of uncertain investments, thereby helping firms identify innovation opportunities without the need for domain knowledge. This trend has raised questions about which firms will primarily benefit from the availability of these datadriven predictions. Contrary to existing research suggesting that data-driven predictions level the playing field for firms lacking domain knowledge, I argue—using a simple theoretical framework—that these predictions reinforce the competitive advantage of firms with domain knowledge. In high-stakes contexts like innovation, where returns are skewed and only a few leads can be pursued, domain knowledge helps evaluate predictions and avoid false positives. I test this idea using novel data on the pharmaceutical industry, exploiting the features of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) that provide data-driven predictions about new drug targets. The results show that GWAS stimulate corporate investments in innovation, yet around one-third of these efforts are misallocated toward false positive predictions. Companies lacking domain knowledge react more strongly but are disproportionally likely to fall into the trap of false positives. Instead, domain knowledge helps firms pursue fewer alternatives that are more likely to be the best opportunities. Together, the results show that even if data-driven predictions are valuable in innovation, domain knowledge remains a crucial source of competitive advantage in the age of big data technologies.",

      "abstractNote": "Although AI has the potential to drive significant business innovation, many firms struggle to realize its benefits. We investigate why some firms succeed in using AI for innovation while others fail, focusing on the organizational support necessary for leveraging AI in both novel and incremental innovation. Specifically, we examine how the Lean Startup Method (LSM) influences the impact of AI on product innovation in startups. Analyzing data from 1,800 Chinese startups between 2011 and 2020, alongside policy shifts by the Chinese government in encouraging AI adoption, we find that companies with strong AI capabilities produce more innovative products. Moreover, our study reveals that AI investments complement LSM in innovation, with effectiveness varying by the type of innovation and AI capability. We differentiate between discovery-oriented AI, which reduces uncertainty in novel areas of innovation, and optimization-oriented AI, which refines and optimizes existing processes. Within the framework of LSM, we further distinguish between prototyping—focused on developing minimum viable products—and controlled experimentation—focused on rigorous testing such as A/B testing. We find that LSM complements discovery-oriented AI by utilizing AI to expand the search for market opportunities and employing prototyping to validate these opportunities, thereby reducing uncertainties and facilitating the development of the first release of products. Conversely, LSM complements optimization-oriented AI by using A/B testing to experiment with the universe of input features and using AI to streamline iterative refinement processes, thereby accelerating the improvement of iterative releases of products. As a result, when firms use AI and LSM for product development, they are able to generate more high-quality product in less time. These findings, applicable to both software and hardware development, underscore the importance of treating AI as a heterogeneous construct, as different AI capabilities require distinct organizational processes to achieve optimal outcomes.",

      "abstractNote": "Emerging research suggests generative AI offers large productivity gains for the software industry, yet the employment impact on less- versus more-experienced software developers remains unclear. Using the public release of Chat-GPT in November 2022 as a natural experiment, we explore the effects of generative AI on the software developer job market, documenting three new stylized facts. First, using the near-universe of online job vacancies, we find the widespread introduction of generative AI resulted in a 16.3 percent drop in the relative proportion of junior- versus senior-level software developer job vacancies. This finding holds even when accounting for month and location fixed effects, controlling for firm size, population, and industry composition, and considering other labor market trends affecting computer and mathematical workers during this period. Second, we find that the relative decline in labor demand for junior- versus senior-level software developers appears concentrated among larger firms and bigger cities while industries with moderate exposure to the software industry were more insulated from the effects of Chat-GPT. Third, we reveal alternative career pathways for potentially displaced junior software developers using an occupation similarity network to identify credible job opportunities for junior software developers that require minimal re-skilling. Our findings are consistent with both recent industry observations as well as the vast literature on skill-biased technological change, reinforcing the notion that technological disruptions do not uniformly eliminate employment but rather reshape the labor market. Policies to create apprenticeships, co-ops, and other subsidized educational opportunities could help preserve future talent pipelines.",
